Event Signup
======
Canvas has a native Scheduler, accessible from the Calendar, which allows for simple signup lists. This Event Sign Up app was developed to handle more complex events that might have multiple sections or rooms within an event, each with their own signup list. Event Sign Up also handles simple sign up lists as well.

For example, the Event Sign Up could be used for a Resume Review event where there are several reviewers located in different rooms at the same time. Other use cases could be for Office Hours or review sessioins.

The features of the Event Sign Up are detailed below:

0. Create signups for events. Users can delete themselves from an event.
0. Option to display names or hide names to student users. Admins always see names.
0. Events can have multiple rooms or groups, with each room divided into timeslots of a set duration.
0. Display # of open timeslots and # people currently registered.
0. Timeslots have a maximum # of signups specified for the event.
0. Full events have the option of allowing for a waitlist that will notify users if availability occurs and automatically move waitlisted users to the open timeslot. Users see the waitlist and their position in the list.
0. Option to email all people signed up for an event to remind them of their time and locaiton.
0. Option to email an announcement with optional embedded files or images to all people who have signed up for an event.
0. Option to import TAs or instructors from the Canvas course for assigning to an event.
